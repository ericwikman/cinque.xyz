need to tag [review,tutorial,series,business,editorial]
it must be at least a full page article to be worthwhile including
i will search for visicalc from 1978 to 2021 for in later years it will often be in an article about the history of spreadsheets which can have neat trivia
if i see a full page article on a spreadsheet program then i add it to the timeline
i need to link to all of the articles on archive.org
lotus 1-2-3, quattro pro, and excel will be future search phrases

### **SuperCalc Spread-Sheet Simulator from Sorcim Corp.** (page 30)

##### Tim Barry

- Full review of SuperCalc:
  - Usefullness (5/5)
  - Documentation (4/5)
  - Ease of Use (5/5)
  - Error Handling (5/5)
- System requirements:
  - CP/M 2.2
  - 48K RAM
  - One disk drive
- Price: \$295
- Article says that VisiCalc does not have a CP/M version, but InfoWorld has previously published that the HP-125 has a CP/M version of VisiCalc (and on page 38 of this same issue)
- CP/M uses serial terminals, not memory-mapped displays like other systems of the time, so updating the display was slow and tedious.
- SuperCalc matches the attributes of the terminal, for instance the author's terminal is a Z-19 running at 9600 baud with 80 character width and 24 rows (1920 bytes of characters, 15,360 bits, at 9,600 bits per second would be aout 2 seconds to refresh the screen (0.5 frames per second))
- Says most memory mapped displays are limited to 40x24 or 64x16 displays
- Can adjust width of all columns
- Row titles can be as long as you want
- Can use other models as inputs to the current model
- Can display results or equations
- Can protect fields
- Can split screen horizontally or vertically
- Author considers it the easiest to use spreadsheet
- Can get help by typing the ? character which tells you all available options
- The first letter of the command is the command shortcut
