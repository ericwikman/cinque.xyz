- Says at least a dozen spreadsheets were showcased at last November's COMDEX
- Genesis of VisiCalc:
  - > VisiCalc was born in 1978, when Dan Bricklin, an M.B.A, student at Harvard, got tired of doing his homework. Or rather, he got tired of completing a lengthy set of calculations, only to find that an early calculation had been erroneous and the whole thing had to be redone.
  - > Bricklin had an idea for a computer program that would ease his frustration by continuously updating his calculations. He showed it to his finance professor, who was convinced it would never sell. The professor sent Bricklin to Dan Fylstra, a recent Harvard grad who was publishing game programs at Personal Software, to confirm the idea's lack of potential. Instead, Fylstra sat Bricklin down at an Apple, and Bricklin had a prototype running in a few days, using game paddles to move the cursor around. Bricklin teamed up with his partner Bob Frankston at Software Arts to write the market version. Fylstra agreed to market the product and acquired exclusive distribution rights. Who says Harvard doesn't make yous mart?
  - > VisiCalc was an immediate sensation. Originally released for the Apple I, it may have sold more Apples than Dick Cavett. Microcomputers running VisiCalc began to show up everywhere, from the desks of small retailers who never thought they'd own a computer, to the desks of middle managers at Fortune 500 companies who found them quicker, more responsive, and more efficient than the Burroughs in the basement.
  - > These managers eventually found the limitations of VisiCalc, although its advantages far outweighed the. Its memory capacity was restricted, its editing functions crude, its text processing primitive. It could not handle conditional (if-then) statements, and formatting the spreadsheet was sometimes cumbersome.
  - > Later versions of VisiCalc have dealt with some of these problems, but strangely, several of the major ones remain unresolved. In addition, Personal Software has concentrated on the Apple, Radio Shack, Commodore and Atari markets. Although VisiCalc is now available on Hewlett-Packard and IBM microcomputers, Personal Software has been slow in adapting its program to a variety of machines and has all but ignored the CP/M market. This has left a substantial opening for other software developers, and COMDEX was the result. Spreadsheet madness has begun to turn back on Personal Software, which was referred to in a recent Computer Business News article as "another vendor of VisiCalc-like packages.
- A promising new feature in spreadsheets is the ability to to associate different worksheets with one another. Multiplan uses sheet-link function, Forecaster and CalcStar uses a consolidation function, and Report Manager uses a three dimensional spreadsheet to accomplish. It allows to use calculated values sourced from another sheet in the current sheet, which can help get around memory limitations.

### Detailed comparison of VisiCalc vs SuperCalc

- Detailed comparison of VisiCalc vs SuperCalc on an IBM PC (EW: it really is an extremely detailed comparison, sort of like what I worked on elsewhere on this site, and in some respects more detailed than my analysis since I'm myopically focused on Cinque. My comparisons are done with the manual, but I would revisit this article post v1 of Cinque, even though SuperCalc v1 is not part of Cinque's roadmap (but v3 through 5.1 are))
- "Visiclones" and "Calcalikes" terms used to refer to a copy-cat program
- Tried to use as much similar commands and structure as possible
