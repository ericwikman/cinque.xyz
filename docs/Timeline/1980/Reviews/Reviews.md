- System requirements:
  - CP/M Based System
  - CBASIC II, v2.04+
  - 48K RAM
  - One disk drive
  - Terminal with cursor addressing

- The review itself is much harsher than the above score. The review makes it sound very difficult to use with poor documentation.
- First "big table" program for CP/M
- Tables are limited to 15 computational columns
- Not menu driven
- Tables can be up to 255 characters in length
- Macro command for repetitive operation
- Buffer feature for copying rows
- Can sort data files
- Can fill previously created masks, such as computer form letters
- I think you create your model in a document, and then process that document to get the results, I do not think it was a real-time updating screen.
