- Model III had 128K of memory, but VisiCalc was still limited to a 63x254 grid, so plenty of RAM for a full spreadsheet
- Also 80 characters of width on the Model III screen
- Mixed case characters makes it easier to read text
- Four-way cursor control makes it easier to move around
- Keys auto-repeat, making it easier to scroll further in the document

  - V-Print is pretty similar to printing with /PP but row numbers are visible
- Aurora Computer Enterprises
  - Visiprint \$39.95

- Discusses buying RAM boards to increase the amount of memory available to VisiCalc. 32K of additional RAM adds about 3100 cells
- Mentions an undocumented limitation of VisiCalc where less cells can be used than memory would allow for. In earlier versions, of the 16k cells in a 63x254 grid, only 9k of the cells are usable, and in later versions only 12k of them
- Performance Manager (Aurora Systems)
  - \$75
  - Budget calculator in VisiCalc
