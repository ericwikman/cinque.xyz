- Both a word processor and a arithmetic package
- Since it is not a machine language program, computation takes longer than VisiCalc
- Possibly the first program of its kind to include sorting

## **SuperCalc** Spread-Sheet Simulator from Sorcim Corp

- 1981-10-05 - InfoWorld - Volume 3 - Number 20
- Tim Barry
- [page 30](https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA70&dq=visicalc&pg=RA1-PA30#v=onepage&f=true)
- Scorecard:
  - Usefulness (5/5)
  - Documentation (4/5)
  - Ease of Use (5/5)
  - Error Handling (5/5)
- System requirements:
  - CP/M 2.2
  - 48K RAM
  - One disk drive
- Price: \$295
- Article says that VisiCalc does not have a CP/M version, but InfoWorld has previously published that the HP-125 has a CP/M version of VisiCalc (and on page 38 of this same issue)
- CP/M uses serial terminals, not memory-mapped displays like other systems of the time, so updating the display was slow and tedious.
- SuperCalc matches the attributes of the terminal, for instance the author's terminal is a Z-19 running at 9600 baud with 80 character width and 24 rows (1920 bytes of characters, 15,360 bits, at 9,600 bits per second would be about 2 seconds to refresh the screen (0.5 frames per second))
- Says most memory mapped displays are limited to 40x24 or 64x16 displays
- Can adjust width of all columns
- Row titles can be as long as you want
- Can use other models as inputs to the current model
- Can display results or equations
- Can protect fields
- Can split screen horizontally or vertically
- Author considers it the easiest to use spreadsheet
- Can get help by typing the ? character which tells you all available options
- The first letter of the command is the command shortcut
