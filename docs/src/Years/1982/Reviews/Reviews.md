## **MBA**: Putting It All Together

- 1982-08-00 - PC (later PC Magazine) - Volume 1 - Number 4
- [page 74](https://books.google.com/books?id=WYnHD9WSWdAC&pg=PA74&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7hL_q3YX1AhXEnGoFHdb9DwYQ6AF6BAgLEAI#v=onepage&q&f=true)
- Possibly the first full "office suite", although the previous year's T/Maker also looked like a suite, but probably unable to fulfill its goal with so little RAM of 1981
- Each cell could contain 8,000 characters
- Could display pie charts, scatter charts, high/low graphs, or several types of bar graphs
- Charts were in a single cell, and you could copy an entire spreadsheet into a cell in order to embed it in a document

## The Challenger: **Multiplan**

- 1982-08-00 - PC (later PC Magazine) - Volume 1 - Number 4
- [page 85](https://books.google.com/books?id=WYnHD9WSWdAC&pg=PA85&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7hL_q3YX1AhXEnGoFHdb9DwYQ6AF6BAgLEAI#v=onepage&q&f=true)
- Preview article of forthcoming Multiplan spreadsheet from Microsoft
- Essentially contains all features of VisiCalc and SuperCalc
- Has additional formatting options, arithmetic and logical functions and an expanded lookup function
- Can perform functions on text
- Could have up to 8 windows on the screen
- Ability to name cells or blocks and use those names in formulas
- Could write formulas with relative cell references (the cell three rows above me)
- Cell references were like "R3C4" instead of "D3" where the R means row number and C means column number (EW: I'm convinced that if Multiplan came out before VisiCalc that this is the standard we would use today, and in fact Excel does use it under the covers, and you can switch modes to use it actively)
- Had "proposed responses" which were based on your previous actions
- Author says proposed responses were correct about 75% of the time
- Could link spreadsheets (use values from one sheet in a formula in another)
- Would forward-calculate all dependent cells. In VisiCalc and SuperCalc, the layout of your sheet mattered, because it either calculated from left to right or top to bottom, but Multiplan would update any cell that used the modified cell as a value and then recursivley do the same for cells that relied on those now updated cells

## Sinclair/Psion Tapes

### **Vu-Calc**

- 1982-08-12 - Popular Computing Weekly - Volume 1 - Number 17
- [page 12](https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1982-08-12/page/n11/mode/2up?view=theater)
- Sinclair Research
- For the ZX81
- Limited to 16K ram
- 936 cells

## Beyond the Peaks of VisiCalc

- 1982-10-00 - BYTE - Volume 7 - Number 10
- Jack Bishop
- [page 29](https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_07-10_1982-10_Computers_in_Business/page/n29/mode/2up?view=theater)
- The Limits of VisiCalc: author was searching for an improved product primarily because of consistantly running out of memory for the models in VisiCalc

### **Desktop Plan II**

- \$250
- VisiCorp (Personal Software)
- Language: BASIC
- 199 page manual

### **Microfinesse**

- \$495
- P-E Consulting Grou Ltd.
- Language: Pascal
- 139 page manual

### **Plan80**

- \$295
- Business Planning Systems Inc.
- Language: CP/M
- 139 page manual
- Model Size Limits: example sizes were used instead of actual limits:
  - Desktop Plan II: 10 columns x 270 rows; 18 columns x 140 rows
  - Plan80: 10 cols x 304 rows; 20 x 183; 30 x 130
  - Microfinesse: 20 cols x 250 rows; 166
- Flexibiity: Desktop Plan II and Microfinesse are very rigid in terms of you must define your rows and columns at the start and cannot add lines or columns or move items around later. Plan80 allows you to use any editor to define your models before opening, which makes it possible to make any changes you need without starting over, but at the cost of not having its own method of editing models
- Graphics:
  - Microfinesse has the most powerful graphics ability, but limited to 24 data points on a single dataset (one line)
  - Desktop Plan II comes in second, while Plan80 is severly lacking
- Score:

## **QuickCalc**

- 1982-10-00 - 80 Micro
- Kurt Leafstrand
- [page 114](https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1982-10/page/n113/mode/2up?view=theater)
- Not a commercial product, but gets a special mention because it was written by an 8th grader and available for free
  - The first sentence of the article by Kurt, 13 years old, is about doing a sales projection without buying VisiCalc. Fast forward to 2021 and Kurt is the SVP of Product for Clari, a Sales Analytics product.
- Source code published in article: less than 200 lines of BASIC
- Max 8 columns and 14 rows
- Runs on TRS-80 Model I or III

## **T/Maker II** offers apples and oranges

- 1982-10-04 - InfoWorld - Volume 4 - Number 39
- John Markoff

- [page 35](https://books.google.com/books?id=EjAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA48&dq=visicalc&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=true)
- a VisiCalc work-alike for TRS I or III
- A full review of the program, but the product faired very poorly, so no elaboration here
- Score:
  - (1/4) for documentation
  - (2/4) for performance, ease of use, and error handline
  - (1.75/4) - average
- Price: \$50

## **ExecuCalc**

## **Lotus** Development Corporation's **1-2-3**

- 1982-12-00 - BYTE - Volume 7 - Number 12
- A fast, versstile package that combines spreadsheet, graphing, and database functions
- Gregg Williams
- [page 182](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1982-12/page/n183/mode/2up?view=theater)
- $495
- 256 columns by 2,048 rows
- Can handle up to 640KB of memory
- For IBM PC, but will be ported to other systems using Intel's 8086 or 8088
- Requires 128KB of memory
- Monochrome monitor can display the spreadsheet, color monitor can display spreadsheet or graphs, on a dual monitor setup the monochrome displays the spreadsheet and the color displays the graphs
- Can make graphs with up to 4 variables
- Graph types:
  - Bar
  - Line
  - Pie chart
  - Stacked bar
  - x-y
- Supports Epson MX-80 printer (more to come)
- Database functionality
  - Not on par with dBASE II but useful integration with the spreadsheet and graphing
  - Database can be anywhere on the spreadsheet, but the sheet can still contain non-database rows/columns/cells as well
  - Record is displayed as a row, which each column being a field
  - Sort records with a primary and secondary sort field (each can be ascending or descending)
  - Query allows to search the database and only matching records are highlighted
  - Retrieve copies the matching records to another area (one matching record per row)
  - VisiCalc for IBM PC has 15 arithmetic, logical, and relational operators, 28 functions, and 32 commands
  - 1-2-3 has 15 operators, 41 functions, 66 spreadsheet commands, and 44 database commands
  - Built-in help file with over 250 screens of information
  - Help screens are cross-indexed to other help screens
  - Possibly first spreadsheet to come with a tutorial program
  - Has a menu system that is very user friendly
  - Can specify cells by pointing to them with the arrow keys
  - Can name a range with a name up to 15 characters
  - Most common 10 commands are wired to the function keys
  - ALT key gives you 26 user-defined macro keys
  - Labels can spill into the cells to the right if they are empy and the label is longer than the columnd wdith of its cell
  - Protected cells prevent certain cells from accidentally being modified
  - Appears to be the first popular commercial spreadsheet written in assembly language instead of a higher-level language. This made it significantly faster than its competitors. However, it also meant that it isn't as portable (meaning it is written using the instruction set of the microprocessor, so you can't take the code for an Intel 8086 and port it to another CPU)
  - The entire program runs in memory, unlike competitors that have to load from file when you switch from the spreadsheet to the graphing abilities
  - VisiCalc, VisiPlot, and VisiDex combined are $700 and significantly less powerful, and way less user friendly and not as well integrated
  - Author clearly states that it is beyond iterative improvements and is the first of a new generation of software
