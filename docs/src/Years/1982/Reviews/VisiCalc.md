- Doug and Denise Green
- [page 48](https://books.google.com/books?id=EjAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA48&dq=visicalc&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=true)
- Gives more memory to VisiCalc Users
- VisiCalc can utilize an extra 16K without modification
- An Apple 48K provides 15K of usable memory for the actual sheet
- You can add 32K, 64K, or 128K which provides a max of 177K of RAM on the Apple 48K
- VC-Expand allows you to use the full 63x254 grid
- It also lets you know when your sheet grows beyond on floppy disk and allows you to use a second
- As a sheet gets larger, calculations take longer, necessitating moving to manual calculation mode at some point
- 49K of memory yields about 4,800 cells of numbers, or only 2,400 formulas
- the /80 version doubles the amount of cells visible at a time, but still limited to 12 total columns
- Price:
  - \$100 for VC-Expand
  - \$125 for VC-Expand/80 (for 80 column screens)
- Score:
  - (4/4) in all 4 categories: performance, documentation, ease of use, error handling
