- Joe Shelton
- [page 143](https://archive.org/details/softalkv2n08apr1982/page/142/mode/2up?view=theater)
- Apple II max file size 34K, VisiCalc III max file size 192K
- III has 80 column display compared to 40 on II, so can fit 8 columns as opposed to 4
- III allows mixed case characters
- III has four cursor keys
- Pretty well written primer on VisiCalc, presumably to get reader to a baseline before the future articles in the series. But recommended read to have a good overview of VisiCalc
