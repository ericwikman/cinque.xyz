### **Battle of the Spreadsheets** (page 20)

##### John Unger Zussman

- Says at least a dozen spreadsheets were showcased at last November's COMDEX
- Genesis of VisiCalc:
  - > VisiCalc was born in 1978, when Dan Bricklin, an M.B.A, student at Harvard, got tired of doing his homework. Or rather, he got tired of completing a lengthy set of calculations, only to find that an early calculation had been erroneous and the whole thing had to be redone.
  - > Bricklin had an idea for a computer program that would ease his frustration by continuously updating his calculations. He showed it to his finance professor, who was convinced it would never sell. The professor sent Bricklin to Dan Fylstra, a recent Harvard grad who was publishing game programs at Personal Software, to confirm the idea's lack of potential. Instead, Fylstra sat Bricklin down at an Apple, and Bricklin had a prototype running in a few days, using game paddles to move the cursor around. Bricklin teamed up with his partner Bob Frankston at Software Arts to write the market version. Fylstra agreed to market the product and acquired exclusive distribution rights. Who says Harvard doesn't make yousmart?
  - > VisiCalc was an immediate sensation. Originally released for the Apple I, it may have sold more Apples than Dick Cavett. Microcomputers running VisiCalc began to show up everywhere, from the desks of small retilers who never thought they'd own a computer, to the desks of middle managers at Fortune 500 companies who found them quicker, more responsive, and more efficient than the Burroughs in the basement.
  - > These managers eventually found the limitations of VisiCalc, although its advantages far outweighed the. Its memory capacity was restricted, its editing functions crude, its text processing primitive. It could not handle conditional (if-then) statements, and formatting the spreadsheet was sometimes cumbersome.
  - > Later versions of VisiCalc have dealt with some of these problems, but strangely, several of the major ones remain unresolved. In addition, Personal Software has concentrated on the Apple, Radio Shack, Commodore and Atari markets. Although VisiCalc is now available on Hewlett-Packard and IBM microcomputers, Personal Software has been slow in adapting its program to a variety of machines and has all but ignored the CP/M market. This has left a substantial opening for other software developers, and COMDEX was the result. Spreadsheet madness has begun to turn back on Personal Software, which was referred to in a recent Computer Business News article as "another vendor of VisiCalc-like packages.
- A promising new feature in spreadsheets is the ability to to associate different worksheets with one another. Multiplan uses sheet-link function, Forecaster and CalcStar uses a consolidation function, and Report Manager uses a three dimensional spreadsheet to accomplish. It allows to use calculated values sourced from another sheet in the current sheet, which can help get around memory limitations.

### **An Interview With VisiCalc Entrepreneur Daniel Fylstra** (page 29)

#### A behind the scenes look at the evolution of VisiCorp.

##### David Bunnell & Lawrence J. Magid

- VisiCorp employs more than 100 people
- It is a thorough interview, but more about Personal Software than about VisiCalc

#### VisiCalc Creators Look Forward to Future Glory (page 30)

- VisiCorp is a \$30 million company
- Frankston and Bricklin building a product called TK!Solver to sell without VisiCorp's involvement
- 250k copies of VisiCalc sold
- Advanced VisiCalc will be developed by Software Arts and still sold and marketed by VisiCorp
- Bricklin: VisiCalc was made for an Apple with 24k of memory, with no hard drive requirement, future versions will "leave SuperCalc in the dust"

### How Much are You REALLY Worth (page 64)

- Multi-page article on building a spreadsheet for Net Worth calculations

### Calc Wars (page 71)

- Detailed comparison of VisiCalc vs SuperCalc on an IBM PC (EW: it really is an extremely detailed comparison, sort of like what I worked on elsewhere on this site, and in some respects more detailed than my analysis since I'm myopically focussed on Cinque. My comparisons are done with the manual, but I would revisit this article post v1 of Cinque, even though SuperCalc v1 is not part of Cinque's roadmap (but v3 through 5.1 are))
- "Visiclones" and "Calcalikes" terms used to refer to a copy-cat program
- Tried to use as much similar commands and structure as possible

#### MBA: Putting It All Together (page 74)

- Possibly the first full "office suite", although the previous year's T/Maker also looked like a suite, but probably unable to fulfill its goal with so little RAM of 1981
- Each cell could contain 8,000 characters
- Could display pie charts, scatter charts, high/low graphs, or several types of bar graphs
- Charts were in a single cell, and you could copy an entire spreadsheet into a cell in order to embed it in a document

### The Challenger: Multiplan (page 85)

- Preview article of forthcoming Multiplan spreadsheet from Microsoft
- Essentially contains all features of VisiCalc and SuperCalc
- Has additional formatting options, arithmetic and logical functions and an expanded lookup function
- Can perform functions on text
- Could have up to 8 windows on the screen
- Ability to name cells or blocks and use those names in formulas
- Could write formulas with relative cell references (the cell three rows above me)
- Cell references were like "R3C4" instead of "D3" where the R means row number and C means column number (EW: I'm convinced that if Multiplan came out before VisiCalc that this is the standard we would use today, and in fact Excel does use it under the covers, and you can switch modes to use it actively)
- Had "proposed responses" which were based on your previous actions
- Author says proposed responses were correct about 75% of the time
- Could link spreadsheets (use values from one sheet in a formula in another)
- Would forward-calculate all dependent cells. In VisiCalc and SuperCalc, the layout of your sheet mattered, because it either calculated from left to right or top to bottom, but Multiplan would update any cell that used the modified cell as a value and then recursivley do the same for cells that relied on those now updated cells

#### Desktop Plan II, Microfinesse, and Plan80 let financial planners handle large and complex models

##### Jack Bishop

- The Limits of VisiCalc: author was searching for an improved product primarily because of consistantly running out of memory for the models in VisiCalc
- Desktop Plan II
  - \$250
  - VisiCorp (Personal Software)
  - Language: BASIC
  - 199 page manual
- Microfinesse
  - \$495
  - P-E Consulting Grou Ltd.
  - Language: Pascal
  - 139 page manual
- Plan80
  - \$295
  - Business Planning Systems Inc.
  - Language: CP/M
  - 139 page manual
- Model Size Limits: example sizes were used instead of actual limits:
  - Desktop Plan II: 10 columns x 270 rows; 18 columns x 140 rows
  - Plan80: 10 cols x 304 rows; 20 x 183; 30 x 130
  - Microfinesse: 20 cols x 250 rows; 166
- Flexibility: Desktop Plan II and Microfinesse are very rigid in terms of you must define your rows and columns at the start and cannot add lines or columns or move items around later. Plan80 allows you to use any editor to define your models before opening, which makes it possible to make any changes you need without starting over, but at the cost of not having its own method of editing models
- Graphics:
  - Microfinesse has the most powerful graphics ability, but limited to 24 data points on a single dataset (one line)
  - Desktop Plan II comes in second, while Plan80 is severely lacking
- Score:

  - (1.75/4) - average
- Price: \$50

### VC-Expand

#### gives more memory to VisiCalc Users

- VisiCalc can utilize an extra 16K without modification
- An Apple 48K provides 15K of usable memory for the actual sheet
- You can add 32K, 64K, oe 128K which provides a max of 177K of RAM on the Apple 48K
- VC-Expand allows you to use the full 63x254 grid
- It also lets you know when your sheet grows beyond on floppy disk and allows you to use a second
- As a sheet gets larger, calculations take longer, necessitating moving to manual calculation mode at some point
- 49K of memory alots for about 4,800 cells of numbers, or only 2,400 formulas
- the /80 version doubles the amount of cells visible at a time, but still limited to 12 total columns
- Price:
  - \$100 for VC-Expand
  - \$125 for VC-Expand/80 (for 80 column screens)
- Score:
  - (4/4) in all 4 categories: performance, documentation, ease of use, error handling

### Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3 (page 182)

#### A fast, versstile package that combines spreadsheet, graphing, and database functions

##### Gregg Williams

- $495
- 256 columns by 2,048 rows
- Can handle up to 640KB of memory
- For IBM PC, but will be ported to other systems using Intel's 8086 or 8088
- Requires 128KB of memory
- Monochrome monitor can display the spreadsheet, color monitor can display spreadsheet or graphs, on a dual monitor setup the monochrome displays the spreadsheet and the color displays the graphs
- Can make graphs with up to 4 variables
- Graph types:
  - Bar
  - Line
  - Pie chart
  - Stacked bar
  - x-y
- Supports Epson MX-80 printer (more to come)
- Database functionality
  - Not on par with dBASE II but useful integration with the spreadsheet and graphing
  - Database can be anywhere on the spreadsheet, but the sheet can still contain non-database rows/columns/cells as well
  - Record is displayed as a row, which each column being a field
  - Sort records with a primary and secondary sort field (each can be ascending or descending)
  - Query allows to search the database and only matching records are highlighted
  - Retrieve copies the matching records to another area (one matching record per row)
  - VisiCalc for IBM PC has 15 arithmetic, logical, and relational operators, 28 functions, and 32 commands
  - 1-2-3 has 15 operators, 41 functions, 66 spreadsheet commands, and 44 database commands
  - Built-in help file with over 250 screens of information
  - Help screens are cross-indexed to other help screens
  - Possibly first spreadsheet to come with a tutorial program
  - Has a menu system that is very user friendly
  - Can specify cells by pointing to them with the arrow keys
  - Can name a range with a name up to 15 characters
  - Most common 10 commands are wired to the function keys
  - ALT key gives you 26 user-defined macro keys
  - Labels can spill into the cells to the right if they are empy and the label is longer than the columnd wdith of its cell
  - Protected cells prevent certain cells from accidentally being modified
  - Appears to be the first popular commercial spreadsheet written in assembly language instead of a higher-level language. This made it significantly faster than its competitors. However, it also meant that it isn't as portable (meaning it is written using the instruction set of the microprocessor, so you can't take the code for an Intel 8086 and port it to another CPU)
  - The entire program runs in memory, unlike competitors that have to load from file when you switch from the spreadsheet to the graphing abilities
  - VisiCalc, VisiPlot, and VisiDex combined are $700 and significantly less powerful, and way less user friendly and not as well integrated
  - Author clearly states that it is beyond iterative improvements and is the first of a new generation of software
