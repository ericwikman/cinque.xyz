- Title: **VisiCalc: User-Defined Problem Solving Package**
- > VisiCalc, soon to be announced by Personal Software, Incorporated, is an interactive program designed to solve problems that require manipulating rows and columns of numbers.
- > Bob Frankston, one of VisiCalc's authors, likens it to a **"magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations"** automatically, once certain data relationships are defined.
- > VisiCalc makes a computer's display screen act as a window onto an imaginary sheet of paper where rows and columns of numbers can be written. The user can move this window to any partof the "sheet" to view different parts of his data. Within the window, he can add, change, delete, copy, and move numbers or blocks of numbers.
- > The user can tell VisiCalc that certain entries have a constant relationship to one another. If he is creating a budget sheet, for example, he can stipulate that the last entry in each column should be the total of the entries above it. **VisiCalc not only calculates the total, but recalculates it automatically whenever an entry in the column is changed.**
- > VisiCalc has provisions for labeling rows and columns; defining entry formats (such as dollars and cents); and splitting the screen into two windows which can be moved independently. Other facilities, such as creating bar charts, are also available.
- > The key to VisiCalc's design, its authors say, is to give the user a highly flexible tool that he can use as he wishes. "VisiCalc allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts," says Frankston. This is in contrast to using a canned program that has a fixed idea of how one should go about budgeting.
- > **Frankston likens VisiCalc to the pocket calculator, which has gained wide acceptance because it aids people in solving problems in their own way.**
- > The formal introduction of VisiCalc is scheduled for the National Computer Conference, being held June 4-7, in New York City. The program will become available a few weeks later from Personal Software and through retail computer stores. The program was demonstrated to retailers at the Fourth West Coast Computer Faire, but was not disclosed to the public.
- > **The initial offering of VisiCalc will be for the Apple II computer, will require 32K of memory, and can use disk or tape for saving data files, but does not require them.** Versions for other machines will follow, first within the 6502 family, and later outside of it. The price of VisiCalc has not yet been determined, but is expected to be under $100.

- Title: **The Visible Calculator**
- Author: Neil Shapiro
- > I was recently allowed to preview **a software program that (in my opinion) will revolutionize personal computing.** With VisiCalc and a home computer, **everyone (not just professionals) will be able to custom-design his own specialized computer programs.** 
- > VisiCalc puts on the screen any section of a grid of about 300 by 300 blocks. Any block, and its relationship to any other block, can be instantly entered by plain English and mathematical formulas. If you want block B1 to be labeled "Profit," you can define it in terms of cost and selling price, or whatever you would like.
- > **If you change a variable, say percent of interest in a savings account, every figure dependent on that variable instantly changes.** Think of all the "what-ifs" you can check out quickly: What a rent increase will do to your family budget; what varying Dow Jones averages could do to your stock portfolio; how changes in wholesale prices will affect your business statement. Possibilities are endless.

     - Features (5/5)
     - Documentation (4/5)
     - Ease of Use (5/5)
     - Error Handling (5/5)
     - Customer Support (5/5)
   - System requirements:
     - Apple II or II Plus
     - 32K minimum, 48K recommended
     - One disk drive
   - Recommended
     - 132-column printer (for financial reports), or 40- or 80-column printer for other applications
   - Price: $150
   - **63 columns and 254 rows**
   - Apple II only had two arrow keys, so the user had to toggle if they were for horizontal or vertical cell movement using the space bar key as the toggle switch
   - Metaphor: Pencil and Paper is to VisiCalc as Cobol is to Fortran. Cobol programmer is going to have a lap full of erasures while the Fortran programmer has finished solving the same problem. 
   - 48K of memory isn't adequate for most applications
   - Many cases of people buying an Apple II just to use VisiCalc
   - July 1980 release date for Atari 800 and PET CBM
   - > **Its primary function is to make the manipulation of numeric data with a computer much easier than with pencil and paper**.
   - > Visicalc can quite properly be described as a tool for financial and numerical programming and forecasting.
   - > Personal Software will be demonstrating Visicalc on the Atari 800 and PET CBM at the 1980 National Computer Conference in Anaheim. Hewlett Packard is also developing a version for the HP 85.

  - 48K RAM
  - One disk drive
  - Terminal with cursor addressing
- Price: $275
- Lifeboat Associates
- The review itself is much harsher than the above score. The review makes it sound very difficult to use with poor documentation. 
- First "big table" program for CP/M
- Tables are limited to 15 computational columns
- Not menu driven
- Tables can be up to 255 characters in length
- Macro command for repetitive operation
- Buffer feature for copying rows
- Can sort data files
- Can fill previously created masks, such as computer form letters
- I think you create your model in a document, and then process that document to get the results, I do not think it was a real-time updating screen.

##### Tim Barry
- Full review of SuperCalc:
  - Usefullness (5/5)
  - Documentation (4/5)
  - Ease of Use (5/5)
  - Error Handling (5/5)
- System requirements:
  - CP/M 2.2
  - 48K RAM
  - One disk drive
- Price: $295
- Article says that VisiCalc does not have a CP/M version, but InfoWorld has previously published that the HP-125 has a CP/M version of VisiCalc
- CP/M uses serial terminals, not memory-mapped displays like other systems of the time, so updating the display was slow and tedious. 
- SuperCalc matches the attributes of the terminal, for instance the author's terminal is a Z-19 running at 9600 baud with 80 character width and 24 rows (1920 bytes of characters, 15,360 bits, at 9,600 bits per second would be aout 2 seconds to refresh the screen (0.5 frames per second))
- Says most memory mapped displays are limited to 40x24 or 64x16 displays
- Can adjust width of all columns
- Row titles can be as long as you want
- Can use other models as inputs to the current model
- Can display results or equations
- Can protect fields
- Can split screen horizontally or vertically
- Author considers it the easiest to use spreadsheet
- Can get help by typing the ? character which tells you all available options
- The first letter of the command is the command shortcut
