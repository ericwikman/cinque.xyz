- VisiCalc: User-Defined Problem Solving Package (page 22)
- > VisiCalc, soon to be announced by Personal Software, Incorporated, is an interactive program designed to solve problems that require manipulating rows and columns of numbers.
- > Bob Frankston, one of VisiCalc's authors, likens it to a "magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations" automatically, once certain data relationships are defined.
- > VisiCalc makes a computer's display screen act as a window onto an imaginary sheet of paper where rows and columns of numbers can be written. The user can move this window to any partof the "sheet" to view different parts of his data. Within the window, he can add, change, delete, copy, and move numbers or blocks of numbers.
- > The user can tell VisiCalc that certain entries have a constant relationship to one another. If he is creating a budget sheet, for example, he can stipulate that the last entry in each column should be the total of the entries above it. VisiCalc not only calculates the total, but recalculates it automatically whenever an entry in the column is changed.
- > VisiCalc has provisions for labeling rows and columns; defining entry formats (such as dollars and cents); and splitting the screen into two windows which can be moved independently. Other facilities, such as creating bar charts, are also available.
- > The key to VisiCalc's design, its authors say, is to give the user a highly flexible tool that he can use as he wishes. "VisiCalc allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts," says Frankston. This is in contrast to using a canned program that has a fixed idea of how one should go about budgeting.
- > Frankston likens VisiCalc to the pocket calculator, which has gained wide acceptance because it aids people in solving problems in their own way.
- > The formal introduction of VisiCalc is scheduled for the National Computer Conference, being held June 4-7, in New York City. The program will become available a few weeks later from Personal Software and through retail computer stores. The program was demonstrated to retailers at the Fourth West Coast Computer Faire, but was not disclosed to the public.
- > The initial offering of VisiCalc will be for the Apple II computer, will require 32K of memory, and can use disk or tape for saving data files, but does not require them. Versions for other machines will follow, first within the 6502 family, and later outside of it. The price of VisiCalc has not yet been determined, but is expected to be under $100.
